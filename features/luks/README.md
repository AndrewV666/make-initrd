# Feature: luks

Feature adds the ability to boot from LUKS partition.

## Boot parameters

- `no-luks` disables crypto LUKS detection.
- `luks-key=<keypath>:<keydev>:<luksdev>` key for luks device on removable device
  - `keypath` is a path to key file to look for.
  - `keydev` is a device on which key file resides. It might be kernel name of devices (should start with "/dev/"), UUID (prefixed with "UUID=") or label (prefix with "LABEL=").
  - If `luksdev` is given, the specified key will only be applied for that LUKS device. Possible values are the same as for keydev. Unless you have several LUKS devices, you donâ€™t have to specify this parameter.
- `luks-key-format=<format>` defines the format of the key file (possible values: `plain`, `raw`)
- `luks-discard` is an array of luks devices specified in same format in luksdev to which discard operation is perfomed (is essential for SSD).
- `luks-ignore` specifies which luks device should be ignored by initrd to decrypt.
- `luks-dev`
